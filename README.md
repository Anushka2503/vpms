# 🚗 Vehicle Parking Management System (VPMS)

This is a web-based project developed as part of **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** in the second year of engineering. The objective of the project was to understand and implement the fundamentals of web development by creating a functional vehicle parking system. This system helps manage incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking area, storing records systematically and allowing easy retrieval based on vehicle numbers.
